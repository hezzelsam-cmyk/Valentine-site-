        I know a lot has changed, and I honestly respect and understand that. I am ready to tackle whatever comes our way. I hope that you can see that my desire to work through all the hard times, all the hardships, and everything in between is genuine. I want this, I desire this, and I am ready to prove it to you. I want us, and I want to build a future together. I want to show you that I am committed to making this work, and I hope you want that too. Let's move forward together, embracing all the changes and challenges, and create a beautiful journey as a team.
