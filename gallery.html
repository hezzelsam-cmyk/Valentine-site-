<h1>Our Moments 📸
l hold all our moments close no matter how small they were
from simply coming over to your house and sleeping together.
To meeting your mum on the first day and how scared l was.
To teaching you how to drive.
To our first kiss
To our new years kiss
To showering together
To cooking for you
All the side quests we took
And all the others l have failed to mention
They give me strength to push through</h1>
