        From all the moments we’ve shared together, I hold them dearly. From teaching you how to drive, to our New Year's kiss, our first kiss, meeting your mom and being scared, to you meeting my mom, our first sleepover at both our houses, our first actual date together, the little adventures we went on, the days we’d cook together, the mornings we’d love each other, the nights we’d cuddle the whole night through, the movies we watched together, the showers we took together, the times we just looked into each other's eyes all day, sending TikToks in bed, and reels. From having our highlights about each other to creating a circle where all that was possible — and all the others I failed to mention. These are just part of a few things we shared that were good, that honestly give us hope that we can rebuild, and I want to do that with you. Create more and more and more memories.
