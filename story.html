<h1>How It Started 💫</h1>
<p>From the first time we talked, something felt different l knew you were my everything since the day l met you
You saved and cared for me like no other so l had to learn to do the same so l did
Being with you was the easiest and best thing one could ask for
l love loving you eachday of my life. l know lm stupid sometimes and become a dickhead but l love you and only you with everything in me
.</p>
<p>You brought peace, laughter, and light into my life.</p>
