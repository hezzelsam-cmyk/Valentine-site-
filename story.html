I know a lot has changed, and it's pain and realization I feel. I understand and respect all you said. I want to do it differently and actually do right right now. You are my sole light in this dark and hopeless world. You were there for me when no one else was, believing in my dreams when I myself didn't believe. I made the mistake of thinking big gestures made things okay, but the small things matter more — making you feel trusted and seen at all times.

I want you all to myself and to actually create an environment where your emotions and peace are protected and respected. I just wish to do it together, rebuilding all we create. Redo all the exciting things like going on dates, the surprises, the late-night calls, the TikToks and reel hours, and all the other things — for I want that with you and only you. I simply hope and pray you grow back into that too.
